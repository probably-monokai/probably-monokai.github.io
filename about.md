I'm a high schooler who wants to be a CS and math double major. I'm a pretty experienced programmer and I draw sometimes too. I'll be writing amateur ramblings here or things I find mildly interesting.

I named myself after [the color scheme by Wimer Hazenberg](https://monokai.pro/) since it is and always has been my favorite text editor theme. However, I mainly use the colors off of [Monokai Night,](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/vscode-monokai-night) whose accent colors are derived from [MonokaiFree.](https://github.com/gerardroche/sublime-monokai-free)
