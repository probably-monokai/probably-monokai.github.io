This is my second time writing this article since I wiped my drive without checking for stashed commits, so I guess this is me paying for that.

I was once playing around with calculus last year trying to see if I could find the angle of intersection between various equations. $$ \cos $x = \sin $x $$ was easy enough, but then I got rid of the $$ \sin $$ and soon figured out that I couldn't even find the analytic solution of the darned thing. As of the time of writing, even [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=cos+x+%3D+x) can't find it.

Doing some research (after having solved it), I discovered the number which solved this is actually called the [Dottie number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dottie_number) and has an interesting property:

$$ \forall $x. (\underbrace{\cos \circ \cos \circ ...}_{\infty})($x) = r $$

where $$ r $$ is the Dottie number. 

Also, if we do

$$ \cos $x = $x $$

$$ \sin(\frac{\pi}{2} - $x) = $x $$

Let $$ $u = \frac{\pi}{2} - $x $$,

$$ \sin($u) = \frac{\pi}{2} - $u $$

$$ \sin($u) + $u = \frac{\pi}{2} $$

The equation actually reveals itself to be an instance of [Kepler's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_equation), where $$ M = \frac{\pi}{2} $$ and $$ e = -1 $$.

# Solving

The solution is predictably non-elementary, and we'll have to use some special functions:

The incomplete beta function

$$ \operatorname{B}($x;\,$a,$b) = \int_0^{$x} $t^{$a-1}(1-$t)^{$b-1}\,\mathrm{d}$t $$

The regularized incomplete beta function

$$ I_{$x}($a,$b) = \frac{\operatorname{B}($x;\,$a,$b)}{\operatorname{B}(1;\,$a,$b)} $$

The inverse regularized incomplete beta function

$$ I_{$x}(a,b) = c $$

$$ $x = I_{c}^{-1}(a,b) $$

## The good stuff

We have

$$ \cos $x - $x = 0 $$

but this form is no good, since the zero will just cancel out everything and we'll lose information because of that. So, we'll use the Kepler form:

$$ \sin($x) + $x = \frac{\pi}{2} $$

taking the derivative of the left side we have

$$ \int \cos $x + 1\,\mathrm{d}$x = \frac{\pi}{2} $$

Let $$ $u = \cos $x $$, then $$ \operatorname{acos} $u = $x $$, and $$ -\frac{\mathrm{d}$u}{\sqrt{1-$u^2}} = \mathrm{d}$x $$, or preferably, $$ -\left(1-$u^2\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\mathrm{d}$u = \mathrm{d}$x $$, and we get


$$ -\int \left($u + 1\right)\left(1-$u^2\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\mathrm{d}$u = \frac{\pi}{2} $$

Let's expand that difference of squares:

$$ -\int (1+$u)(1+$u)^{-\frac{1}{2}}(1-$u)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\mathrm{d}$u = \frac{\pi}{2} $$

Adding the exponents:

$$ -\int (1+$u)^{\frac{1}{2}}(1-$u)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\mathrm{d}$u = \frac{\pi}{2} $$

Now our integral is *almost* like the definition of the incomplete beta function. Let $$ $w = 1 - $u $$, so $$ $u = 1 - $w $$ and we just have to switch the negative sign:

$$ \int $w^{-\frac{1}{2}}(1 + (1 - $w))^{\frac{1}{2}}\mathrm{d}$w = \frac{\pi}{2} $$

$$ \int $w^{-\frac{1}{2}}(2 - $w)^{\frac{1}{2}}\mathrm{d}$w = \frac{\pi}{2} $$

This part took me a bit to figure out, but it's pretty trivial in retrospect: Let $$ $w = 2$\alpha $$, so $$ \mathrm{d}$w = 2\,\mathrm{d}$\alpha $$

$$ 2 \int (2$\alpha)^{-\frac{1}{2}}(2 - 2$\alpha)^{\frac{1}{2}}\mathrm{d}$\alpha = \frac{\pi}{2} $$

$$ 2^1\,2^{-\frac{1}{2}} 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \int $\alpha^{-\frac{1}{2}}(1 - $\alpha)^{\frac{1}{2}}\mathrm{d}$\alpha = \frac{\pi}{2} $$

and we can divide both sides by $$ 2 $$:

$$ \int $\alpha^{-\frac{1}{2}}(1 - $\alpha)^{\frac{1}{2}}\mathrm{d}$\alpha = \frac{\pi}{4} $$

So this is really

$$ \operatorname{B}\left($\alpha;\,\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{\pi}{4} $$

or

$$ \operatorname{B}\left(\frac{1 - \sin $x}{2};\,\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{\pi}{4} $$

So unfortunately there is no widely recognized inverse incomplete beta function, but we can rearrange the definition of the regularized beta function like so:

$$ I_{$x}($a,$b) = \frac{\operatorname{B}($x;\,$a,$b)}{\operatorname{B}(1;\,$a,$b)} $$

$$ \operatorname{B}($x;\,$a,$b) = I_{$x}($a,$b)\operatorname{B}(1;\,$a,$b) $$

So now we have

$$ I_{\frac{1 - \sin $x}{2}}\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}\right)\operatorname{B}\left(1;\,\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{\pi}{4} $$

$$ \operatorname{B}\left(1;\,\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}\right) $$ nicely evaluates to $$\frac{\pi}{2} $$:

$$ I_{\frac{1 - \sin $x}{2}}\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}\right)\frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4} $$

$$ I_{\frac{1 - \sin $x}{2}}\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} $$


and now use the inverse:

$$ \frac{1 - \sin $x}{2} = I^{-1}_{\frac{1}{2}}\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}\right) $$

$$ $x = \operatorname{asin}\left(1 - 2I^{-1}_{\frac{1}{2}}\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}\right)\right) = 0.739085... = r $$

By the way, let me know if you want me to attempt the absolute monster integral 

$$ \int \operatorname{atan}(\cos $x)\,\mathrm{d}$x $$
