Junior year of highschool, even though my appeal to be enrolled into the Calculus BC class was unsuccessful, I decided to enter the classroom during my off period regardless and "take" both Precalculus and Calculus BC simultaneously. My love for solving integrals by hand started when they first taught $$u$$-substitution that day.

Anyways, today (still junior year), I found this problem by accident:

Solve 

$$ \int x^{ln x}\,\mathrm dx $$ 

in terms of 

$$ \operatorname{erfi}(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int e^{x^2}\,\mathrm dx $$

Obviously, it's a non-elementary integral, so we need to algebraically manipulate the integrand or perform $$u$$-substitution to get it into the form of $$ e^{x^2} $$.

The first step is not very obvious, but it's really helpful to get to our end goal.

$$ \int x^{\ln x}\,\mathrm dx = \int e^{\ln(x^{\ln x})}\,\mathrm dx = \int e^{\ln^2 x}\,\mathrm dx $$ 

Now this gets us close to our desired $$ e^{x^2} $$, but unfortunately a simple $$u$$-substitution won't get us here. Nevertheless, we're going to do it anyway.

Let $$ u = \ln x $$. Therefore, $$ du = \frac{1}{x}\,dx $$ or $$ x\,du = dx $$. Since we can't have $$ x $$ in the final substitution, we use the fact that $$ x = e^u $$ and thus $$ e^u\,du = dx $$.

Substituting $$ \ln x = u $$ and $$ dx = e^u du $$,

$$ \int e^{\ln^2 x}\,\mathrm dx = \int e^{u^2} e^u\,\mathrm du = \int e^{u^2 + u}\,\mathrm du $$ 

So close. I was stuck on this admittedly for an hour.

Though, I thought back to a simple equation that my math teachers appeared to have a hard time proving from the right side:

$$ \sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{3}} $$

The analogy is that the state that our integrand is much like the right side of this equation: unfactored.

$$ 2\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{8 - 4\sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2})^2} = \sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2} $$

Let's do that with our integrand. I'll invent a variable $$ \phi $$ to make sure we don't make any manipulations that change the value of the expression.

$$ u^2 + u = \phi $$

Complete the square:

$$ (u + \frac{1}{2})^2 = \phi + \frac{1}{4} $$

$$ (u + \frac{1}{2})^2 - \frac{1}{4} = \phi $$

Therefore,

$$ \int e^{u^2 + u}\,\mathrm du = \int e^{(u + \frac{1}{2})^2 - \frac{1}{4}}\,\mathrm du $$

You may be thinking that we've replaced our problem with another problem, but remember, there is no variable in $$ \frac{1}{4} $$, so we can move it outside of the integral.

$$ \int e^{(u + \frac{1}{2})^2 - \frac{1}{4}}\,\mathrm du = \int \frac{e^{(u + \frac{1}{2})^2}}{e^{\frac{1}{4}}}\,\mathrm du = \frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{e}} \int e^{(u + \frac{1}{2})^2}\,\mathrm du  $$

We're done! We can let $$ w = u + \frac{1}{2} $$, and the factored form will reduce to a single variable, adhering to our $$ e^{x^2} $$, but that isn't strictly necessary.

We just need to rearrange 

$$ \operatorname{erfi}(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int e^{x^2}\,\mathrm dx $$

into

$$ \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \operatorname{erfi}(x) = \int e^{x^2}\,\mathrm dx $$

and we have

$$ \frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{e}} \int e^{(u + \frac{1}{2})^2}\,\mathrm du = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2\sqrt[4]{e}} \operatorname{erfi}(u + \frac{1}{2}) $$

Don't forget to substitute $$ u = \ln x $$ and add $$ +\:c $$ .

$$ \int x^{ln x}\,\mathrm dx = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{\sqrt[4]{e}} \operatorname{erfi}(\ln x + \frac{1}{2}) + c $$
